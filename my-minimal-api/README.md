# My Minimal API

This is a simple .NET Minimal API project that demonstrates how to create a basic web application that responds with "Hello World".

## Project Structure

- **Controllers/**: This directory is currently empty but can be used to store any future controllers if needed.
- **Program.cs**: The entry point of the application, setting up the minimal API and defining the endpoints.
- **my-minimal-api.csproj**: The project file containing information about the project, including dependencies and build settings.

## Getting Started

To run the application, use the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to see the "Hello World" response.
